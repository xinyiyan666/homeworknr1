                <p><b>What Makes Us, Ginger Cats,So Special?</b>"Because ginger cats are not a distinct breed, it's difficult to make generalizations about their personalities and temperaments. That being said, all ginger cats do share one key characteristic, aside from their orange coloration, of course: they are tabbies.In fact, all domestic cats carry the tabby gene, though they may not always exhibit an obvious tabby pattern.

                    Every ginger cat is unique, but because they all carry the tabby gene, they have certain characteristics in common. For example, all tabbies have a distinctive M-shaped marking on their foreheads. The rest of their patterning is determined by genetics."</p>

                <h1>What is a ginger cat?</h1>
                <p>A cat who's fur lands anywhere along the color spectrum from pale yellow to orange to deep red. While gingers don’t carry the questionably sinister reputation of black cats, or the haughty, aloof personality of Persians, their orange purr-sonas can be a complicated mix of several feline traits. It’s in their genes.

                    Whether you call your ginger purrball a cinnamon, red, marmalade or tiger cat.</p>

                We, ginger cats, love to talk! "Anyone who has lived with one of these orange felines can report that they’re very talkative. Their gregarious voices emit a variety of sounds like chirping and trilling, and while other cat types may typically vocalize only when they’re hungry or want to go outside, gingers seem to use their voices for their own pleasure, and their pet parent’s. From self-reported surveys to vets and zookeepers, the numbers are in: ginger cats, by far, vocalize the most!""
